# üé® Unnamed Social Media Art Project by Kade Angell

## Description

Welcome to my yet-to-be-named social media art project! This platform prompts users with colors and a theme, inviting them to draw something creative. Once the masterpiece is ready, users can upload it for the world to see. The project uses an Express backend and a SvelteKit frontend, all written in TypeScript.

## üõ† Technologies

Backend: Express with TypeScript
Frontend: SvelteKit with TypeScript
## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- TypeScript globally installed (`npm install -g typescript`)
### Installation
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kade-Angell/your-project-name.git
```
2. Install backend dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
3. Install frontend dependencies
```bash
cd ../frontend-web
npm install
```
## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Project

### Backend
Navigate to the `backend` directory and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the Express server and build the frontend, and you'll be able to view the entire project running.

### Frontend (For Development Purposes Only)
Navigate to the frontend-web directory and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This is specifically for frontend development. It will start Vite, allowing you to develop and test the frontend portion in isolation.

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Development Notes

### TypeScript
This project is built using TypeScript for both the backend and frontend. Make sure you're comfortable with TypeScript conventions.

*Backend TypeScript Configuration*

The tsconfig.json in the backend directory configures TypeScript for Node.js and Express. Ensure that you're exporting your types and interfaces properly.

*Frontend TypeScript Configuration*

The svelte.config.js and tsconfig.json in the frontend-web directory set up TypeScript for SvelteKit.

### Express
I'm using Express for routing on the backend. Check out the routes folder to add or modify API endpoints.

### SvelteKit
The frontend is built with SvelteKit. Check out src/routes to add or modify frontend pages.
